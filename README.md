# üéì Student Score Processor(Data Processing Pipeline)

This Dart program processes a list of student data, demonstrating robust data manipulation using Dart's collection methods and null safety features. It's designed to take raw student information, transform it, filter based on criteria, and perform aggregations.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Data Transformation:** Converts raw `Map` data into structured `Student` class objects for easier manipulation.
* **Score Calculation:** Leverages the `map` collection method to create a new list where each student's score is calculated and updated.
* **Intelligent Filtering:** Employs the `where` method to efficiently filter the list, identifying students who have achieved a score of 70 or higher.
* **Aggregated Analytics:** Utilizes the `fold` method to calculate the total score of all processed students, showcasing powerful data reduction capabilities.
* **Comprehensive Null Safety:** Implements Dart's null-aware operators (`??`, `??=`, `?.`) throughout the pipeline to gracefully handle potential null values, ensuring program stability and reliability.
